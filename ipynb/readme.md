# Notebooks to illustrate the signal separation problem
This list of the Google Colab notebooks loads two data files. Take a look at the instructions below on how to load. The number before each title is the number that precedes the filename. 

- Visualize the dimensionality of the span of signal basis, [10](10_SingularValuesDecomposition.ipynb)
- Reconstruct the mixed signal given a known basis, [11](11_GetData_FindTheBasis.ipynb)
- Select features and their optimal number to approximate the target, [12](12_SingularValuesDecomposition.ipynb)
- Plot the probability of the collision-free transmission, [1](1_Plot_Birthday_Probability_NQ.ipynb)
- Find the centroids of the signal clusters, [9](9_Distance_to_6bit.ipynb)
- Two-class of Aloha collision detections, early draft [A](AlohaCollisionDetector2class_Feb7.ipynb)
